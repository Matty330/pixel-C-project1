User Story: Fortune Cookie App
As a user, I want an engaging fortune cookie experience that allows me to crack open a digital fortune cookie, receive fortunes in multiple languages, and enjoy fun animations and sounds, so that I can have a memorable and interactive experience each time I use the app.


Acceptance Criteria:

Fortune Cookie Animation:

When I click the "Crack the Cookie" button, I see the fortune cookie visually crack open, revealing a fortune slip.
A cracking sound effect plays during the animation to enhance the experience.
Fortune Message Display:
After the cookie cracks open, a fortune message appears on a slip of paper.
I can see a new fortune every time I click the button.
Language Selection:
I can choose my preferred language (English, Spanish, French) from a dropdown menu.
The app displays the fortune in the selected language after I crack open the cookie.
My language preference is remembered for future visits.
Fortune History (Optional):
I can view a list of previous fortunes I received in a separate section.
The history resets when I refresh or clear it manually.
User Experience Enhancements:
I see a visually appealing, cookie-themed background and design.
The app includes celebratory confetti or animations after the fortune is displayed.
A daily limit option (if desired) encourages me to return for a new fortune each day.
Share Feature (Optional):
I can share my fortune on social media with a pre-filled message and a link to the app.
Additional Technical Requirements:
Local Storage:
The app uses local storage to remember my language preference and, if enabled, my fortune history.
Responsive Design:
The app looks good on both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring a pleasant experience on any screen size.
Accessibility:
All features, including animations and language selections, are accessible to users with different needs (e.g., screen readers, easily identifiable button labels).
